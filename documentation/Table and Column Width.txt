It seems to me that, after a bit of playing around with the current table structure, the past team made some custom
implementation that serves us no use. It is astoundingly hard to make changes to. There is a solution, as react has a built in
thing called react tables that I beleive we should use instead.

I am making this documentation folder, and this document, as a way to document the 2 hours I've spent on this today.

Even with no code changes, all of this is for the better as i know, tomorrow, I need to reimplement the entire thing.

That should.. take some time.
