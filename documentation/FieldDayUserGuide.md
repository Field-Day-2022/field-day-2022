# Introduction
Welcome to Field Day! Field Day is an application sponsored by Dr. Heather Bateman, a biologist and researcher at Arizona State University.

This application is split up into two different entities:
- Field Day Desktop App
- Field Day PWA (mobile application)

This guide extensively covers how to use the Desktop application. A guide for the mobile app is still a work in progress!

# Getting Started

### Creating an Account
Field Day is currently set up to only allow ASU emails to log in. Please sign in with your ASURITE ID.
Our desktop application also requires a password to access the data once you are authenticated through ASU.
Please reach out to Dr. Bateman for this password and access.

### Logging In
The Desktop Field Day app is located at : https://asu-field-day-webui.web.app/login

Sign in to this portal by hitting log in and logging in with your ASU-affiliated Google account.

## Application Features
### Dashboard Overview
This is main screen once you have authenticated through your ASU email. All tabs are different tables of different critters caught out in the field.

Currently, there are 7 different tabs:
1. Turtle
2. Lizard
3. Mammal
4. Snake
5. Arthropod
6. Amphibian
7. Session

Each tab

One of the most important things to take note here is the Data Source Tab:

This tab switches between which set of data to use. There are two selections: Live and Test
- Live is the live database. This is the most up-to-date data and the live data being collected in the field. Be careful when editing this data!
- Test is a test environment. These entries are mostly the development team testing out different features on the application to make sure they work. Change these entries to your heart's desire.
